# Personal Portfolio
My personal website is my creative playground, a space where I express myself through code, explore the art of web development, and share what I love to build.
This is a **Single Page Application (SPA)** built with **Vue.js**. The app uses Vue's integrated router to handle smooth navigation between sections, providing an engaging user experience. **TypeScript** is used for better code quality, static typing, and maintainability. Additionally, the app is **dockerized**, which simplifies deployment and makes it easily runnable in any environment.

## Features

- **Vue.js**: A powerful framework for building dynamic and reactive user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Static typing that improves code quality and provides better development tools.
- **Vue Router**: Built-in routing to enable navigation without page reloads, making the app fast and seamless.
- **Dockerized**: The entire application is containerized, which ensures easy deployment across different environments.

## Purpose

This portfolio serves as both a showcase for my skills and a personal project that highlights the technologies I work with. It demonstrates my passion for creating modern, efficient, and visually appealing web applications. The website includes details about my previous projects, the technologies I've used, and some insights into my development process.
